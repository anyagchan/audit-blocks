## Description

This project implements a peer-to-peer blockchain system designed for garment factories to securely log and verify worker shift hours. The system provides tamper-proof logging through cryptographic signatures and distributed consensus, ensuring that shift records are authentic, auditable, and resistant to fraud or manipulation.

Workers record their shift start and end times, while supervisors digitally sign and verify each entry to confirm its authenticity. These signed records are bundled into blocks, mined through a proof-of-work mechanism, and distributed across a decentralized network of peers. The blockchain ensures that all shift data remains immutable and verifiable, providing a transparent and trustworthy log for compliance, auditing, and fraud prevention.

## Structure of the Code

- **`peer.py`**: Implementation for peer node logic
- **`tracker.py`**: Central tracker that keeps track of a list of all active peers and broadcasts updates
- **`blockchain.py`**: Implementations for Block and Transaction classes, mining, Merkle root, PoW
- **`demo_api.py`**: API endpoints for the demo application
- **`frontend/`**: contains the frontend components for the demo application, demo application design
- **`DESIGN.md`**: describes the blockchain design, p2p protocol,
- **`TESTING.md`**: describes the set of tests for demonstrating blockchain resilience

## Compilation
